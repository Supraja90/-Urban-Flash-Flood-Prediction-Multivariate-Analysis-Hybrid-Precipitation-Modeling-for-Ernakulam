# Urban-Flash-Flood-Prediction-Multivariate-Analysis-Hybrid-Precipitation-Modeling-for-Ernakulam
• Investigated urban flash flood dynamics and created hybrid machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy.
• Integrated Neural Networks with LightGBM and XGBoost to create a hybrid model. Utilized performance metrics such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score for model evaluation.
• Achieved an R² score of 0.86, marking a substantial improvement in forecasting accuracy. This result provided more
dependable assessments of flood risk
